Opensea NFT Pricing Research

This repository contains the code and data for a research project focused on analyzing the pricing dynamics of NFT collections on Opensea. The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of how pricing is determined in the NFT market and to identify factors that influence the value of NFTs.

As a researcher with a background in finance and blockchain technology, I am interested in studying the NFT market to gain insights into this emerging asset class. I believe that understanding the pricing dynamics of NFTs can provide valuable information for investors, collectors, and other market participants.

This research project will involve collecting and analyzing data from Opensea to identify patterns and trends in NFT pricing. The code and data in this repository will be used to develop models and visualizations that can help us better understand the NFT market.
